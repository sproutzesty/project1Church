Description: I wanted to show what you could do with limited knowledge of coding and a small budget could achieve. I used Google work Space to make forms more dynamic for the client as well as safe and secure. The client wanted to be able to retrieve data without paying an additional service like "Formspree". This site will need a few more details and pages for it to be everything the client ever wanted, however I am able to proudly say this is the first step.

Technology used: html, css, bootstrap 4, javascript, iframe

Future plans of Improvement:

Adding a Live Video page connected to Facebook Live, it would hold the pre-existing video and when recording new content you would replace the video. Connects to FB Live as well allowing for Autotomy and no need to replace codes weekly. (added cost to client for service)
Adding video content from Youtube channel, currently the client has no videos from YouTube but is trying to start more media outreach. When the content becomes available I would post welcome videos and other website videos to bring a more intimate atmosphere to the site.
Shortly after posting this on Github, the filling out of content and meeting with the clients would be done in person. Allowing for a better hands on feel from the clients prospective.
